# Who want's to play a game? - FCC Edition
We all know the Unites States federal government and the ABC clubs are about as efficient as car with 3 flat tires, so naturally, the process to get your license CAN be an aggrivating keyboard smashing extravagansa. Thats where this little guide comes into play. There ARE several guides out there, unfortunatly, they are outdated, specifically when it comes to the payment portion.

So lets get started!
# !!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!!
The FCC pages that are part of this process, at times, can be VERY slow. Like 1996 AOL dial-up slow. Just be patient. Dont click the back arrow on your browser or start clicking random things. You will only upset the FCC gods.

## Step 1 - Registration with the FCC overlords! (Part 1)
Remember when I mentioned the inefficiencies of our ABC clubs? It wasn't a joke. During this process, it will require registering with the FCC twice, using two different sites of theirs. NOW, IF you already have you HAM license, or any other license with the FCC, you can skip this part. You'll need to first visit this site [FCC - Commission Registration System (CORES)](https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do) and click register. Go through that process, and eventually you end up with a 10-digit FRN number. You will need that so write it down or copy it into notepad for the next step.

## Step 2 - Registration with the FCC overlords! (Part 2)
You will now use that 10-digit FRN number you got, and the password you used to log into the FCC Cores system (from step 1) and log-in with the FCC a second time, at a completely different FCC website. How fun and efficient! So visit [FCC - License Manager (https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsEntry/licManager/login.jsp) and get yourself logged in.

## Step 3 - Apply for a New License
As the stemp implies, you will now be applying for the actual license. On the left side menu bar, at the top, you will see a link "Apply for a New License". You will click that and begin the process. The first page has a single drop down menu. You will scroll down all the way to ZA
