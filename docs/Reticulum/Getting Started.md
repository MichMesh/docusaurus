## Setup
### You will probably want to create a python venv specifically for reticulum stuff.
`cd ~/ ; python -m venv reticulum`
### load the new python venv
`. ~/reticulum/bin/activate`
### install rns, lxmfd 
```pip install --upgrade rns lxmf```
Start rnsd to generate the config files, then ctrl-c out:
```rnsd
^c
``` 
### edit ~/.reticulum/config 
Use the following to configure your machine as a bridge to all on the same subnet with the michmesh test net. This test net is also connected to the Chicago test net, which is connected to a European test net. The connection to the euro net will likely be dropped once we get a critical mass of services running.
```
[reticulum]
  enable_transport = True
  share_instance = Yes
  shared_instance_port = 37428
  instance_control_port = 37429
  panic_on_interface_error = No
[logging]
  loglevel = 4
[interfaces]
  [[Default Interface]]
    type = AutoInterface
    enabled = Yes
    name = Default Interface
    selected_interface_mode = 1
    configured_bitrate = None
  [[michmesh TCP]]
    type = TCPClientInterface
    interface_enabled = true
    target_host = rns.michmesh.net
    target_port = 7822
    name = michmesh TCP
    selected_interface_mode = 1
    configured_bitrate = None
```
## Clients
### nomadnet
If you want to install the console based nomadnet:
`pip install nomadnet`
### meshchat
If you prefer a web based interface, use meshchat. You can install from the [releases](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat/releases) section of the [meshchat repo](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat) or build using the instructions from the main [README.md](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat/blob/master/README.md)

### Sideband
Sideband is a Linux/Android/MacOS/Windows LXMF client. 
For mobile connectivity or if you already have a transport node configured above on the network, you dont need to do the following. 
To setup TCP connection to the test net:
- click the hamburger menu,
- click `Connectivity` 
- enable `Connect via TCP`
- TCP Host: RNS.MichMesh.net
- TCP Port: 7822
- x out of the config 
- restart Sideband.
You should now be seeing things show up in the announce stream.
## Radio interfaces
### LoRa
Reticulum is not like other meshes - the LoRa node acts more like a [TNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller) - at current time, you need to install the [rnode firmare](https://liamcottle.github.io/rnode-flasher/) and create an [interface in your config](https://reticulum.network/manual/interfaces.html#rnode-lora-interface).
[We use the common settings for the US.](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/wiki/Popular-RNode-Settings#united-states)
For Sideband, connect to the rnode via bluetooth, then enable `Connect via RNode` under connectivity, then restart sideband.
For rns/nomadnet/Meshchat, add the following connection to your ~/.reticulum/config
```
[[RnodeUSB]]
  type = RNodeInterface
  interface_enabled = true
  port = /path/to/usb/or/bluetooh/port
  frequency = 914875000
  bandwidth = 125000
  txpower = 20
  spreadingfactor = 8
  codingrate = 5
  name = RnodeUSB
  selected_interface_mode = 1
  configured_bitrate = None
  mode = boundary
```
### HF FreeDV-TNC2 6.792mhz - in flux
Connect your radio to your computer using whatever radio interface you choose.
Follow the install instructions for [FreeDV-TNC2](https://github.com/xssfox/freedvtnc2)
Start freedvtnc2 with the reqd sound options as well as the following `--kiss-tcp-port 8001 --kiss-tcp-address 127.0.0.1`
add the following to your ~/.reticulum/config interfaces
```
[[TCP KISS Interface]]
  type = TCPClientInterface
  enabled = yes
  kiss_framing = True
  target_host = 127.0.0.1
  target_port = 8001
  mode = boundary
```
