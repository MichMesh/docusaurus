Much like with your Mesh nodes, height is might, and the less "junk" in the way the better. Even in poor conditions with subpar antennas on your HT (hand held aka walkie-talkie) you can expect a few miles of range between you and another HT. Like with our favorite LoRa devices, there are ways to improve range and reception, and GMRS is no different. I won\'t get into the weeds here, that\'s for later. What\'s important is the "need" for it when it comes to off-grid coms. As mentioned above, what GMRS is NOT good for is LONG distance. You can\'t contact your sad HAM Uncle Jim in Tennessee or his \'Nam Vet buddy in Texas. What you CAN do is either connect to a local repeater to gain what ill call "regional" access depending on the repeater and its location, OR put up your own repeater and help serve your town, neighborhood, etc AND again, one license to serve all your devices. That also means you, your spouse, your 19 kids, your red-headed stepchildren, stepparents, grandparents, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and in-laws can use the same license. The exception is non-related household members can ONLY use your equipment under your license in an emergency. Again, like our LoRa devices, there are plenty of portable and mobile options to bring your communication "network" with you on things like offroading, hiking, and camping trips, or build out your own "network" on your property. Lastly, the equipment can be simple charge-and-play to feature rich with lots of options including monitoring other frequencies like the aviation UNICOM channels. In summary my dear readers, it\'s an effective yet reasonably priced form of communication that is semi-expandable, doesn\'t require testing, and most importantly, doesn\'t require never ending ridicule from your Uncle Jim.'})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:i}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return i?(0,o.jsx)(i,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453(e,i,t){t.d(i,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var n=t(6540);const o={},a=n.createContext(o);function s(e){const i=n.useContext(a);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(i):{...i,...e}},[i,e])}function r(e){let i;return i=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:s(e.components),n.createElement(a.Provider,{value:i},e.children)}}}]);
